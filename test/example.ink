    h2 About Blotter
    _Blotter_ is a frontend engine for Inkjs meant to run on the web or within hybrid platforms like Electron and Cordova. It uses inkjs as its core game engine, and is otherwise a dependencyless implementation of a front-end interface for Ink stories.
    It includes some basic formatting features, including _emphasis_, __strong__, 'smart' "quotes", and dashes - both en and -- em.
